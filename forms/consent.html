<i>This consent form, a copy of which will be left with you for your records and reference, is only part of the process of informed consent. It should give you the basic idea of what the research is about and what your participation will involve. If you would like more detail about something mentioned here, or information not included here, you should ask. Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand any accompanying information.</i><br/><br/>

<b>Purpose</b>: This study is a group collaborative research project by the students of PSYC 4540 T39/7310 T34, an honours/graduate course in the Psychology Department at the University of Manitoba. The experiment looks at participants' ability to judge an infant's age, sex and the language the infant is learning based on short auditory clips of the infant's vocalizations (babbling). We will also be exploring factors that might influence how well people can make these judgments.<br/><br/>

<b>Procedure</b>: 
In this experiment, you will hear a series of short audio clips of babble, one at a time or in batches of 10. You will be asked a question about each clip. Your task will be to answer the questions based on your best judgement. All answers will be collected by the computer. At the end of the study, we will ask some information about you and your experience with infants.<br/><br/>

<b>Risks and benefits</b>:
There are no risks involved greater than that which you might experience in your everyday activities. You may benefit from participating by gaining experience with scientific research in psychology.<br/><br/>

<b>Your privacy</b>: Your digital data file will be shared publicly as part of our dataset on a researcher website (<b>https://osf.io/2a6b4</b>). However, the data will be stored in a form that will preserve your anonymity. Your identity will not be shared with anyone.<br/><br/>

<b>Compensation</b>: This experiment takes about 30 minutes to complete and you will receive 1 experimental credit (SONA) or $2 (MTurk) for your participation.<br/><br/>

<b>Voluntary withdrawal</b>: Even after you consent to participate in the experiment, you can choose to withdraw your participation at any time during the study and with no consequences. <i><b>For SONA participants only:</b></i> if you choose to withdraw from the experiment, please let the experimenter know, and you will be free to leave the experiment without penalty. If after completing the study you would like your data to be deleted, the researcher must be informed immediately as there will be no identifying information linked to your responses after you leave the room. <i><b>For MTurk participants:</b></i> it is not possible to withdraw your data once you have completed the study as the data are anonymous. <i><b>Data from participants who leave partway through the study will automatically be deleted.</b></i><br/><br/>

<b>Feedback</b>: You are welcome to learn more about our research objectives and (as they become available) our results on the lab website: https://osf.io/2a6b4. Please don't hesitate to email us if you have any questions or comments about the study through the Instructor (M_Soderstrom@umanitoba.ca).<br/><br/>

<b>Dissemination</b>: The experimental data collected, and results of the study will be published on Open Science Framework (<b>https://osf.io/2a6b4</b>), and may be published in a researcher manuscript archives and/or in a peer reviewed journal. We will put a link to any such further publications on the Open Science Framework page.<br/><br/>

<b>Consent: <i>MTurk participants:</i></b> please print a copy of this consent form for your records. <b><i>SONA participants:</i></b> you will be provided with a hard copy of the consent form to take home with you.
