	  <b>Project Title</b>: Example of Running a jsPsych Experiment Online?<br/>
    <b>Supervisor</b>: Name Here<br/>
    <b>Student Researchers</b>: Other Names<br/>
<b>Website: https://github.com/SmithBradleyC/jsPsych_Online_Experiments</b><br/><br/>

<i>This is where you put all of the important information to have on a consent form. Changing it as you need or see fit.</i><br/><br/>

<b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate how a jsPsych experiment can be hosted online.<br/><br/>

<b>Procedure</b>: For this example experiment, you will be shown words in coloured text and asked to identify the colour of the text.<br/><br/>

<b>Risks and benefits</b>:
There are no risks involved greater than that which you might experience in your everyday activities. Data is being collected if you complete the experiment and you have the opportunity to identify yourself if you decide to. This repository and database is public so people could have access to how quickly you respond to coloured text.<br/><br/>

<b>Your privacy</b>: Your digital data file (only saved if you complete the experiment) may be shared publicly (<b>https://github.com/SmithBradleyC/jsPsych_Online_Experiments</b>). However, the data will be stored in a form that will preserve your anonymity unless you provide an identifying value in the survey questions.<br/><br/>

<b>Compensation</b>: This experiment takes about 3 minutes to complete and your only compensation is the learning experience I'm trying to provide with the GitHub repository.<br/><br/>

<b>Voluntary withdrawal</b>: Even after you consent to participate in the "experiment", you can choose to withdraw your participation at any time during the study and with no consequences. Just close the web browser.<i><b>Data from participants who leave partway through the experiment will not be saved.</b></i><br/><br/>

<b>Feedback</b>: This is not a read study and as such no feedback will be provided. Check out the website for more info: https://github.com/SmithBradleyC/jsPsych_Online_Experiments. Feel free to email if you have questions: (smithb21@myumanitoba.ca).<br/><br/>

<b>Dissemination</b>: The data collected will be stored on a publicly accesible Firebase Database. It will not be officially published in any form.<br/><br/>
