Your task will be to try and identify characteristics of the baby making those sounds (age, sex, familial language). You will respond by selecting the corresponding button when presented. Please make these judgements based on your initial impressions. Also, when prompted to provide a word, respond by typing in the word 'puppy'. When presented with audio buttons, you must listen to all audio clips before responding and if there are multiple audio clips they are guaranteed to be from the same child.</p>"+"<p>Press any key to begin.</p>";
